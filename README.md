- 👋 Hi, I’m Marialine, an MSc Student in geosciences at the University of Montpellier, France
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding the mechanisms of deformation and how it is distributed evolves throughout time and scales, even if I'm more fascinated by microscopic processes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fortran, because most of the codes I'm interested in are writen in this language. I'd like to model relation between stress and strain of course, and to find a way to process EBSD data in an open-source language. 
- 💞️ I don't search a collaboration for the moment because I'm preparing my Master's thesis, which don't leave me a lot of time left. Nevertheless, please feel free to contact me if you have any proposition.
- 📫 How to reach me : on github !
-    Languages : Python, Matlab, R
